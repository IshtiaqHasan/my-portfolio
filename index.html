            <p>Today is Father’s Day and I’d like to dedicate this post to all the wonderful fathers, father figures,
                and male mentors out there who have touched the lives of people out there: be it your own kids, others’
                kids, your family, people you’ve mentored, people you’ve coached, and the world at large. Thank you for
                all that you do. Thank you for being you. We appreciate your existence and the often times silent but
                impactful role you have played in our lives.
            </p>

            <h3>Importance of Marriage</h3>
            <p>The foundation of the family in Islam is blood ties or marital commitments. Islam builds the family on
                solid grounds that are capable of providing reasonable continuity, true security and mature intimacy.
                Marriage is a part of life, family as well society. The universality of marriage in different societies
                and cultures is attributed to the many basic social and personal functions. From Islamic point of view,
                marriage is a religious duty, a moral safeguard and a social commitment. Islam views it as a strong bond
                terming by Mithaqun Ghaleez that means a challenging commitment.</p>
